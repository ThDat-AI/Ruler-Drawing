# 📏 Ruler Drawing Game

An interactive visualization game that helps users better understand the **Ruler Drawing Problem** and the **Divide & Conquer algorithm** using a simple and engaging interface built with **Streamlit**.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

The **Ruler Drawing Problem** is a classic example used to illustrate how **recursive algorithms** work, particularly the **Divide & Conquer** strategy. This interactive app allows users to:

- Visualize how a ruler is constructed recursively.
- Adjust the level of detail (ruler depth).
- Experiment with different ranges from point A to point B.
- Observe how the algorithm operates step-by-step with animation.

## 🚀 Features

✅ User-friendly interface via Streamlit  
✅ Real-time recursive visualization  
✅ Adjustable start/end points (A, B) and recursion depth (H)  
✅ Handles decimal values with precision  
✅ Prevents invalid inputs with smart constraints  
✅ Suitable for teaching, demos, or learning algorithms interactively
